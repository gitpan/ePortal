INSTALLATION

        Install and test all of them. It's the most important part of
        installation!

    * make ePortal
                perl Makefile.PL  [HOME=/home/ePortal] [PREFIX=/usr/local]
                make 
                make install

        Here HOME is home of ePortal where bin, comp_root, samples, images
        directories will be created and files copied.

         $HOME -- bin
            |-----comp_root
            |-----images
            |-----samples

    * Create datastore
        Before you run any of ePortal's utility set some environment
        variables:

        Unix/Linux:

            export EPORTAL_DBI_SOURCE=dbi:mysql:mysql_read_default_group=<...>;database=<...>;
            export EPORTAL_DBI_USERNAME=<username>
            export EPORTAL_DBI_PASSWORD=<...>

        WindowsNT: Use Control Panel/System to set system wide variables

        Now you may create datastore:

                cd bin
            perl ePortal.pl

    * crontab
        Install crontab. See samples/crontab as example.

    * logrotate
        Install logrotate script. See samples/logrotate.d/ePortal as
        expample.

        example.

        Point your browser to http://your_server_name/admin/index.htm and
        setup menu, users and other things.

    * Speed UP
        You may need to set anvironment variable for speed up (see
        Params::Validate)

         export PERL_NO_VALIDATION=1

    directory with editor.

            download Application-ver.tgz
            tar zfxv Application-ver.tgz

            perl Makefile.PL HOME=/home/ePortal
            make
